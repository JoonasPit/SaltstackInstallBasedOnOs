# Saltminiproject
This module was written as the last project for my centralised-server controlling course. To have this module work one must have a working master-minion connection between two computers and saltstack installed.
Some documentation is available at https://www.bloglinux.me/node/19

## Goal of the project
The goal of the module was to create a salt-module that could automatically recognize the operating system of the minion and then after recognizing the os use the correct protocols to either alter something on the machine or just simply install a package on the machine to demonstrate a working connection.

## Operating systems used
* Xubuntu 18.04 LTS
* CentOs 7
* Fedora 27
* Kali Linux
* Windows 10
* Debian(jessie)
